Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that studies how computers and human languages interact, enabling computers to comprehend, decipher, and produce human language. NLU and NLG are subfields of NLP, with NLU focusing on comprehension and NLG on language generation. Modern NLP applications include emotion detection, language translation, and chatbot systems. There are three main approaches to NLP: rule-based, statistical, and neural. The rule-based approach uses predetermined rules and patterns, while the statistical approach uses machine learning methods, and the neural approach uses neural networks. The writer is interested in NLP and wishes to expand their knowledge for personal and professional use, including sentiment analysis and chatbot building.

This project is essentially a simple data validation and processing program that reads employee data from a file in CSV format, validates the data, and adds it to a unique list for future reference. The program requires the user to enter an employee ID and phone number in specific formats, which are checked for validity before being added to the list.

Python is a popular language for text processing, as it has built-in libraries and tools for handling and manipulating text data. However, it may not be the fastest language for processing large amounts of text, which could be a potential weakness.

In this project, the program serves as a review of basic programming concepts, such as file input/output, string manipulation, and data validation. Additionally, it highlights the importance of clear communication when explaining technical concepts, as the program's instructions and prompts need to be easily understood by a broad audience. Overall, this project is a practical example of how programming can be used to process and manage data efficiently.
