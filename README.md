Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that studies how computers and human languages interact, enabling computers to comprehend, decipher, and produce human language. NLU and NLG are subfields of NLP, with NLU focusing on comprehension and NLG on language generation. Modern NLP applications include emotion detection, language translation, and chatbot systems. There are three main approaches to NLP: rule-based, statistical, and neural. The rule-based approach uses predetermined rules and patterns, while the statistical approach uses machine learning methods, and the neural approach uses neural networks. The writer is interested in NLP and wishes to expand their knowledge for personal and professional use, including sentiment analysis and chatbot building.
